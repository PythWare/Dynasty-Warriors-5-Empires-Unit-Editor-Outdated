This is a Unit Editor for Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires. Credit goes to God(Christian), Michael for documentation on Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires, and myself for the programming. 
It mods the unit data and it works for all region versions of the game. To use the script or executable place it in the same directory as your Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires game and rename the game's file to "DW5E.iso" and place the icon
files into the DW5E_Ico_Files folder.

You need Python installed for the pyw file or you can use the executable version which does not require Python installed since it is a standalone script.
